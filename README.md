Algorithm for predicting mass transfer in electrochemical reactors with periodic sections under limiting current conditions, considering fully developed incompressible flow in both laminar and turbulent regimes. 

Descibed in: based on the code of Coe and Holland (https://doi.org/10.51560/ofj.v3.113) with some modifications. 

The proposed strategy is fully functional in OpenFOAM version 2312.
